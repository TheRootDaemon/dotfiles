# Dotfiles

This repo contains configs for, 

- Starship
- Neovim
- Ghostty
- zsh
- tmux

The following command installs the plugin manager for zsh
```bash
sudo pacman -S zsh-antidote
```
The following command installs some utils for neovim 
```bash
sudo pacman -S wl-clipboard ripgrep luarocks python-pynvim
sudo npm insatall -g neovim
```
Make sure to install tmux plugin manager before using configs for tmux
Also i used the $HOME/.config format
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Note the the commands are specific for Arch Linux

I might add a few more in future ......
